# About

This is my personal website. I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
the [flexible-jekyll](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/flexible-jekyll/)
theme. This repo is meant to keep track of the changes I've made to the orignal
theme.

# Dependencies

After following the
[Jekyll Installation Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/),
execute the following to install the gems in the Gemfile:

    $ cd /path/to/sergiogarciavergara.com
    $ bundle install

# Usage

Execute the following to start hosting the website locally:

    $ cd /path/to/sergiogarciavergara.com
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

## General Notes

* When adding a new image to posts, try to add one that is 1280px in width, and
  make it such that it has a transparent background. This will make the post
  more aesthetically pleasing.
