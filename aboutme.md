Hello! I am a Roboticist from Puerto Rico interested in solving complex problems
by leveraging the power of autonomy. I've had the pleasure of applying my skills
in various fields including healthcare and national security. Long-term, I
envision applying my skills towards helping society with natural disaster events
like forest fires, floods, and hurricanes. I don't yet know how that will look
like, but I am excited to see what the future brings!

I am the CTO and co-founder of [RIF Robotics, Corp][rifrobotics]. At RIF
Robotics we are developing an automated sterile processing department to help
hospitals automatically clean, sterilize, and manage surgical instruments with
robotics and artificial intelligence. We are alleviating the burden of hospital
staff having to perform utility tasks such that they can better focus on their
clinical tasks and the patients.
