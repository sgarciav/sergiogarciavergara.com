I am a Roboticist from Puerto Rico interested in solving complex problems by
leveraging the power of autonomy. I've had the pleasure of applying my skills in
various fields including healthcare and national security. Long-term, I envision
applying my skills towards helping society with natural disaster events like
forest fires, floods, and hurricanes. I don't yet know how that will look like,
but I am excited to see what the future brings!
