Hello! I am a Roboticist from Puerto Rico interested in solving complex problems
by leveraging the power of autonomy. I am seeking opportunities to offer my
consulting services to individuals or organizations in need of expert advice and
guidance in the field of **robotics** and **automation software**.

I have worked with various robotics platforms (ground and aerial mobile
vehicles, humanoids, and manipulators), I have extensive experience with ROS and
ROS 2, and in developing software for autonomous collaborative swarms,
perception, and general manipulation. You can refer
to [my portfolio][my-portfolio] for additional information on the projects I've
worked on and the technical skills I've improved on and acquired while working
on those projects.

My consulting services can cover a wide range of areas, from system design to
implementation and testing. I am also available to provide training and support
to your engineers in areas where you may need to expand your robotics
capabilities.

Feel free to send me [an email][sergiodot] or schedule a 30 min consultation
chat via my calendar below. I would love to discuss how I can assist your team
in developing and deploying innovative robotics solutions. Chat soon!
