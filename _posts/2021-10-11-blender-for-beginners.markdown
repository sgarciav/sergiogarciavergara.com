I'm writing this post as I learn about Blender myself. The intention of this
post is to keep track of what I learn as I go. Hopefully it'll serve as a
learning base for others.

Download the executable from [this link](https://www.blender.org/download/). You
should be able to run Blender by executing:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd /path/to/blender-xxx
$ ./blender
$ sudo /bin/bash -c "printf \"wemux pair\nexit\n\" >> /home/pair/.profile"
$ sudo /bin/bash -c "printf \"Match User pair\n    PasswordAuthentication no\n\" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
{% endhighlight %}
