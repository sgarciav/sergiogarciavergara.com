`Blender`

I'm writing this post as I learn about the animation features that `Blender`
offers. The [official website](https://www.blender.org/) is an excellent
resource. The intention of this post is to keep track of what I learn as I
go. Hopefully it'll serve as a learning base for others.

As you read through, keep in mind that `Blender` offers a wild variety of
features and can be used for SO many purposes. As my current purpose is to learn
specifically about the animation features, what you read will focus specifically
on anything animation related and will skip other

## Hotkey Cheatsheet <a id="headerlink" name="blender-hotkeys" href="#blender-hotkeys" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>

<!-- TODO: Consider making this cheatsheet into a downloadable PDF so others can -->
<!-- reference. -->

The following is a list of hotkeys to facilitate interactions with `Blender's`
interface:

**Keyboard Interactions**:

* `Ctrl + Space`: Make a panel fullscreen. Press again to exit fullscreen view.
* `Shift + A`: Open the "Add" menu to add new objects.
* `Shift + Space`: Open the tools panel at your cursor location which contains:
  select box, move, rotate, and scale. (You can also press `t` on the keyboard.)
* `Shift + Right-click`: Click at the location where you want the 3D cursor to
  appear, which marks the spawning point of a new object and can be used as a
  reference for pivoting.

**Pie Menus**:

* `Shift + S`: Select "Cursor to World Origin" to reset the position of the 3D
  cursor to the origin of the map.
* `Z`: Choose how to view your world (e.g., wireframe vs original).

**Mouse Interactions**:

* `Right click on panel edges`: split scren to add another panel / join panels.
