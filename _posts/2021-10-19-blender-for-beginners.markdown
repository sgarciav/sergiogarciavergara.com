`Blender`

I'm writing this post as I learn about `Blender`
myself. The [official website](https://www.blender.org/) is an excellent
resource. The intention of this post is to keep track of what I learn as I
go. Hopefully it'll serve as a learning base for others.

# Installation <a id="headerlink" name="blender-installation" href="#blender-installation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>

Download the executable from [this link](https://www.blender.org/download/). You
should be able to run Blender by executing:

``` shell
$ cd /path/to/blender-xxx
$ ./blender
```
