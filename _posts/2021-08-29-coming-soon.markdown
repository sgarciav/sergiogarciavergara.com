My personal website is live! First post will be coming soon. Stay tuned while I
add the missing feauresto the website. In the meantime, read on Jekyll below and
see how easy it is to create your first static webpage.

### Info on Jekyll

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most
out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests
at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them
on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
